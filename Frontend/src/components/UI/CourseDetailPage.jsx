              Course), students acquaint themselves with the Arabic alphabet.
              They learn to recognize and pronounce individual letters and their
              combinations. Additionally, they acquire basic Tajweed rules,
              which emphasize correct pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm when
              reciting the Quran. This ensures that the divine text is recited
              in the manner it was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
              him).‚Äù Throughout the course, students practice reading selected
              verses and passages from the Quran, gradually progressing in their
              proficiency and fluency. The goal is to enable students to recite
              the Quran accurately and confidently, whether in personal worship
              or communal settings.
